        <h3><em>Week One</em><br><strong>1.</strong> Getting Started with Tableau Software  </h3>
        <p>
                will consist of theory and recipes with a focus on the learning foundation of Tableau and 
                allowing you to get familiar with the Tableau interface and basic tasks such as creating 
                simple charts, tables, and filtering. You will come to understand the semantic layer of 
                Tableau. You will learn through examples made with real data collected through a large 
                market research study.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Data Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
                will guide you through the process of manipulating data in Tableau using census data. 
                From connecting to data sources, through adding multiple sources, joining them, and 
                blending them—after practicing the recipes in this chapter, you will feel confident
                manipulating data sources in Tableau. Additionally, you will learn how to use the 
                Tableau Pivot functionality, and set the semantic layer of your workbook to suit the
                requirement of the task by practicing converting measures to dimensions, continuous
                to discrete, and editing aliases.

        <p>
            will cover how Tableau dashboard performance is boosted using extracts. You will be
            informed about the different types of Tableau file formats and types of extract. The
            chapter introduces you to Tableau's new in-memory, blazingly fast data engine technology
            called Hyper, which was released in October 2017. Step-by-step instructions will help
            users learn how extremely large datasets can be sliced and diced in seconds using Hyper
            and hence improve the speed of analysis. This chapter will enable you to optimize the
            performance of your Tableau dashboards using aggregated extracts, dimension reduction,
            extract filters, incremental extract refreshes, and cross-data joins.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>4.</strong> Desktop Advanced Calculations</h3>
        <p>
            will start to explore the rest of Tableau Desktop functionality, such as table calculations
            ,calculated fields, parameters, sets, groups, and level of detail expressions. Steps by
            step, you will learn how to leverage the full power of Tableau. This chapter is full of
            useful recipes that help you to master Tableau Desktop skills, from simple table
            calculations to advanced level of detail expressions, helping you to become a more
            advanced Tableau developer. The chapter uses real-life marketing data and will cover
            population geospatial use cases.

        <h3><em>Week Three</em> <br><strong>5.</strong> Tableau Desktop Advanced Filtering</h3>
        <p>
                covers filters from A to Z. After getting 
                familiar with filtering in the first chapter, you will expand your skills. Through 
                practical exercises that use data from the packaged food industry, you will have an 
                opportunity to master all kinds of filters—you will learn about implementing date filters,
                 measure filters, top N filters, table calculation filters, and action filters. This 
                chapter will also teach you how to manage the relationship between multiple filters by 
                adding them to context.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>6.</strong> Building Dashboards</h3>
        <p>
                will focus on dashboard design techniques. This chapter will introduce the concept of 
                dashboards and go through the process of designing a dashboard. Using real-life data about
                internet usage, you will start by making a basic dashboard before building on it by adding
                custom formatting and advanced functionalities. Moreover, you will learn about the role of
                visualization and the importance of using the right design layout in order to use the full
                power of Tableau and create awesome dashboards. Finally, you will build a self-service 
                dashboard.

        <h3><em>Week Four</em> <br><strong>7.</strong>Creating Stories with Tableau</h3>
        <p>
                covers creating stories with data. Through practical examples made with real-life business
                data from the automotive industry, you will learn how to use Tableau functionality for 
                making stories in a way that is What this book covers engaging and accessible to the 
                audience, while at the same time accurate in communicating the message.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>8.</strong>Tableau Visualization</h3>
        <p>
                introduces techniques for creating advanced visualizations with Tableau Desktop. Here we go
                beyond Tableau's Show Me feature and instead look at the exact technique for how to master
                advanced visualizations that can make your dashboard story stand out from the crowd. We 
               cover multiple use cases and recommend the best practice for each visualization, along with
                detailed steps for creating each one of them. The use cases vary from identifying elements
                in the data to create the biggest impact, to creating ranks for different categories over 
               a period of time to visually track goals for organizations, to comparing multiple measures 
               for performance over time. This chapter uses multiple different datasets for each 
               visualization, such as an American football dataset, an unsatisfactory customer service 
               dataset from the hospitality industry, US state college rankings, a stock prices dataset, 
               CO2 emissions from energy consumption, FY18 PMMR spending and budget data, and more.

        <h3><em>Week Five</em><br><strong>9.</strong> Tableau Advanced Visualization</h3>
        <p>
                builds on what was covered in the previous chapter. The use cases vary from comparing 
                multiple categories with high values in the 80-90% range, identifying the dominant players 
                in the flow, and creating part-to-whole relationships, to visually eliminating size Alaska
                Effect. This chapter uses multiple different datasets for each visualization, including 
                football league data, Wikipedia clickstream data, ITA's market research data, retail sales 
                marketing profit and cost data, and statewise US population distribution data.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>10.</strong>Tableau for Big Data</h3>
        <p>
                looks at how visualizing data is important—regardless of its volume, variety, and velocity! 
                The approach to visualizing big data is especially vital, as the cost of storing, preparing,
                and querying data is much higher. Organizations must leverage well-architected data source
                and rigorously apply best practices to allow workers to query big data directly. In this
                chapter, we address the challenges of visualizing big data; the best practices for
                leveraging Hadoop, S3, Athena, and Redshift Spectrum directly; and how you can deploy
                Tableau on big data at massive scale.
